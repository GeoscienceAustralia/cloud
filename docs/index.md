## Download or clone the theme

First download or clone the theme from the [Github repo](https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll). Most likely you won't be pulling in updates once you start customizing the theme, so downloading the theme (instead of cloning it) probably makes the most sense.

## Build this theme

If you're used to running Jekyll sites, you can type the normal jekyll command, `jekyll serve`, to build the Jekyll theme. However, if you're a new Jekyll user or if you run into issues, see the following two topics:

* [Install Jekyll on Mac][mydoc_install_jekyll_on_mac]
* [Install Jekyll on Windows][mydoc_install_jekyll_on_windows]
