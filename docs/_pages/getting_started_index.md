### Getting started on AWS

1. Join [Slack](https://geoscience-australia.slack.com/signup). It's a great place to ask questions.
2. Get an account in the AWS Dev space - send a Slack message or an email to the Autobots to get the ball rolling.

### Create an AWS space
1. Create an account at (https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/):
  * The name for your account should be 'ga-aws-(up to 12 characters)'. For example, 'ga-aws-bumblebee' for the Bumblebee project.
  * The email can either be a GA mailbox (contact the Service Desk) or ga.autobots+______@gmail.com (e.g. ga.autobots+bumblebee@gmail.com).
  * Financial approval and cost/activity code from your delegate.
2. Remember not to enter your payment information! Contact the Autobots to get your new account added to GA's Consolidated Billing first.
3. If you used a GA mailbox, click the link from Consolidated Billing.
4. Rename your space from its account number to 'ga-aws-_____'.
5. Add MFA to your root account.

### Getting started with Continuous Delivery

1. Make sure your code is in version control in Github or Bitbucket.
2. Get started with your pipeline:
  * If you're using Github, you'll be using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/). Start by adding a .travis.yml to your repository.
  *  If you're using Bitbucket, you'll be using [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines-792298921.html). This link has all the information you need to get started.
