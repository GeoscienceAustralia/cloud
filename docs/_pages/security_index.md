### So I'm writing code...
* Have you had a look at the [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Cheat_Sheet)?
* Have you checked out the [CWE Top 25](http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html#Listing)?

### So I've got an AWS space...

* Have you enabled [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/) on all user accounts in your space?
* Are you running [Cloudsploit](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/cloudsploit-lambda) regularly to audit your space?
* Have you read [AWS security whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/)?
* Are you making sure not to commit your AWS credentials to public repositories? One solution could be [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
* Are you using [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/)?
