<h2>Cyber security incidents</h2>

We recommend that you implement a process to identify, report and contain any cyber security incident that could affect GA information. We suggest you deploy and manage tools (**list of tools link**) in such a way that they are capable of detecting and responding to information security incidents. Regular system integrity checks must be performed to detect deviation from the expected configuration.

Consider some of the following tools for detecting potential cyber security incidents:

    anomaly detection system
    intruder prevention system
    log analysis
    network and host-intrusion detection systems
    system integrity verification.

Report cyber security incidents to GA cloud manager, including the cause of the incident and what remediation has occurred. Reporting must occur within 48 hours of the incident occurring.

It is recommended the cyber security incidents are recorded in a register. At a minimum, the register should include:

    the date the incident was discovered
    the date the incident occurred
    a description of the incident, including the personnel and locations involved
    the action taken
    the date reported
    the file reference.
