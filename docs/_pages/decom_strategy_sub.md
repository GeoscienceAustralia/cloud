We love to create new applications. We're also terrible at decommissioning existing applications.

Consider the following when creating a new application:

 * How long is the application likely to be around?
 * Who will be providing operational support?
 * What is the likely cost of ongoing support?
 * Who is the decision-maker for decommissioning the application?
 * How will this decision be made?
