### 101

We value collaboration, openness, and innovation. We back ourselves to make the best decisions for GA.

### Tools

Developers are welcome to choose their own tools. If you don't know what to choose, talk to other teams. They'll point you in the direction of tools that we have a lot of experience with in the organisation. That way, you can be sure of getting help if you hit problems. Some examples might be:

* Python or Javascript
* AWS
* Pipelines or Travis

If you want to use something funky, go for it. If you suspect the project might make its way into production, though, you might want to check in with some other developers first. They'll give you good feedback about whether or not the tools you're using are likely to be supportable, scalable, and reliable enough for a production system.

### Open Source

Open source your code if possible.

### Agile

Develop your stuff iteratively with as much user input as possible. Get a minimum viable product out there as soon as possible.

### In short...

Think of the big picture. Take supportability and security into account. Do the best for GA. Make something awesome.
