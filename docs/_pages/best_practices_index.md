<h2>Criteria for Best Practices</h2>

Geoscience Australia (GA) believes that identifying “Best Practices” involves sound judgement, research and collaboration. Such judgements require prior analysis using the following set of criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, sustainability, possibility of duplication, partnership, community involvement, and organisational commitment. Its this criteria that has set the fundamental framework to governor the way GA can effectively develop and collaborate within a cloud environment.  

**Effectiveness:** <br>
This is a fundamental criterion implicit in the definition. The practice must work and achieve results that are measurable.

**Efficiency:** <br>
The proposed practice must produce results with a reasonable level of resources and time.

**Relevance:** <br>
The proposed practice must address the practices of use within a cloud environment.

**Sustainability:** <br>
The proposed practice must be implementable over a extended period of time without any massive injection of additional resources. 

**Possibility of duplication:** <br>
The proposed practice, as carried out, must be replicable in any IT environment. 

**Involvement of partnerships:** <br>
The proposed practice must involve satisfactory collaboration between several stakeholders. 

**Community involvement:** <br>
The proposed practice must involve participation of the affected users.

**Orginisational commitment:** <br>
The proposed practice must have support from GA and all its staff.

By definition, a “Best Practices” should meet at least the “effectiveness”, “efficiency” and “relevance” criteria in addition to one or more of the other criteria. A “Best Practice” needs not meet all the above criteria. This is because a “Best Practice” can be anything that works to produce results without using inordinate resources, in full or in part, and that can be useful in providing lessons learned.
