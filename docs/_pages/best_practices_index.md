<h2>Introduction</h2> 

Geoscience Australia (GA), presents a set of best practices that will allow the GA community to utilise cloud based computing infrastructure in a manner that ensures community development & collaboration, reduced governance and increased innovation, these practices will also outline various recommended standards to help protect (security, auditing and monitoring) and assist users (tools and patterns) users throughout their cloud journey.   

GA believes that identifying “Best Practices” involves sound judgement, research and collaboration. Such judgements require prior analysis using the following set of criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, sustainability, possibility of duplication, partnership, community involvement, and organisational commitment. It’s this criterion that has set the fundamental framework to governor the way GA can effectively develop and collaborate within a cloud environment.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Effectiveness:**	| *This is a fundamental criterion implicit in the definition. The practice must work and achieve results that are measurable.* |
| **Efficiency:**	| *The recommended practices must produce results with a reasonable level of resources and time.* |
| **Relevance:**	| *The recommended practices must address the practices of use within a cloud environment.* |
| **Sustainability:**	| *The recommended practices must be implementable over a extended period of time without any massive injection of additional resources.*|
| **Possibility of duplication:**	| *The recommended practices, as carried out, must be replicable in any IT cloud environment.* |
| **Involvement of community:**	| *The recommended practices must involve satisfactory collaboration between those in the community.* |
| **Community involvement:**	| *The recommended practices must involve participation of the affected users.* |
| **Organisational commitment:**	| *The recommended practices must have support from GA and its entire staff.* |

By definition, a “Best Practices” should meet at least the “effectiveness”, “efficiency” and “relevance” criteria in addition to one or more of the other criteria. A “Best Practice” needs not meet all the above criteria. This is because a “Best Practice” can be anything that works to produce results without using inordinate resources, in full or in part.
 
<h2>Implementation of Practice</h2> 
Collaboration and innovation in an agile environment is seen by GA as an important fundamental to producing quality work in an open environment. These fundamentals translate into the following methodologies, GA recommends that these methodologies are consulted and practiced when operating in the GA cloud space, as these will promote the above mentioned within our community:    

| | |
|---|---|
| **Open source** | Developing and collaborating within an open source environment will help promote other community members to get involved in GA projects. Allowing many heads to contribute to a project will ultimately lead to creating improved innovation. GA recommends you consult the open source best practice {link}. |
| **Agile** | Agile is a methodology in which changes can be implemented in quick succession, and allows for problems to be resolved in a timely manner without the restrictions of a traditional project timeline. This methodology is critical when working and collaborating in a shared and open environment. GA recommends consulting the GA Agile best practice {link} |
| **Lean** | The key concept of Lean thinking is, ‘Continuous, fast and quality improvement, by removing waste’, GA recommends considering how process and rigmarole can be strategically removed from projects and replaced with basic fundamentals to improve quality and time, both now and in the future. GA lean best practice will lead you in the right direction to promote this culture in your projects {link} |

To help maintain a community standard within the cloud environments, GA recommends the use of a particular set of tools and patterns, these have been selected to kick start and continue innovation and improve community collaboration.

Ensuring that your project, data and environment is secure and running the way you and GA expect it should, GA recommends consulting the GA best practices for Security, auditing and data, these recommendations have been based around industry and government standards, and are proven practices.

GA actively seeks community input to developing GA cloud best practices. Seeking community input will create an ever evolving and fine-tuned set of standards that will alleviate hindrances from projects and environments but improves on them, ultimately achieving GA project goals.
