### Getting started on AWS

1. Join (Slack)[https://geoscience-australia.slack.com/signup] and ask questions
2. Get an account in the AWS Dev space - send a Slack message or an email to the Autobots to get the ball rolling
3. Create an AWS space for your project - follow the process in Confluence (Autobots can help out)
