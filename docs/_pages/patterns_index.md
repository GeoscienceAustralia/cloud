### Getting started on AWS

1. Join [Slack](https://geoscience-australia.slack.com/signup). It's a great place to ask questions.
2. Get an account in the AWS Dev space - send a Slack message or an email to the Autobots to get the ball rolling.
3. Create an AWS space for your project. There's a page about this in Confluence (and the Autobots can help out). To begin with, you'll need:
  * A name for your account - it should be 'ga-aws-(up to 12 characters)'. For example, 'ga-aws-bumblebee' for the Bumblebee project.
  * A mailbox. It should be the same name as above - i.e. ga-aws-bumblebee@ga.gov.au. Raise a request to the support desk for this.
  * Financial approval from your delegate.
4. You can begin the [sign up process with AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?nc2=h_ct), but remember not to enter your payment information! You'll need to get your new account added to GA's Consolidated Billing first. Send out a Slack message or email the Autobots to get this done.
5. Email GA's AWS account manager to get your account converted to invoicing. If you don't know who this is - you guessed it, turn to Slack or the Autobots. :)

### Getting started with Continuous Delivery

1. Make sure your code is in version control in Github or Bitbucket.
2. Get started with your pipeline:
  * If you're using Github, you'll be using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/). Start by adding a .travis.yml to your repository.
  *  If you're using Bitbucket, you'll be using [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines-792298921.html). This link has all the information you need to get started.
