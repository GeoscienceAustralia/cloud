### Software we write

As much as possible, our software development projects should be open source and hosted on public repositories. We believe that GA, as a government organisation, should be as transparent as possible. As a scientific organisation, we value openness and peer review. Open sourcing as much of our software as we can is the logical extension of these core beliefs.

### Software we use

Using open source software has a number of benefits for GA staff, including:

* Increased interoperability from use of open standards
* Fewer restrictions on software use
* Ability to scrutinise code, leading to increased security and stability
* (Often) no upfront payment
* Reduced vendor lock-in
