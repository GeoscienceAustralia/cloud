### Introduction

At GA, we're finding that the values of the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) are resulting in positive changes for individuals, teams, and projects:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

This is an iterative, incremental approach to development, and one which encourages and empowers individuals to contribute.

The central tenets of this approach are:

* Work with your target audience
* Define a measurable goal
* Make small steps with visible impact
* Continually validate
* Measure success
* Reflect, adjust, iterate

### Practices

A number of teams follow some Agile 'rituals':

* Standups
* Retrospectives
* Sprints
* Sprint planning
* Scrum-of-scrums

It's important to remember that these rituals are simply in pursuit of the end-goal of creating value for GA, and not an end in themselves! We are constantly evaluating the usefulness of processes like these.
