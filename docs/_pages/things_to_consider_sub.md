### Getting started

1. Join [Slack](https://geoscience-australia.slack.com/signup), our messaging app. It's a great place to ask questions.
2. Join the #awscop and #autobots channels to chat with experts from across GA.

### Things to consider

Each AWS space owner is responsible for ongoing management of their AWS space. This includes:

 * Security
 * Monitoring
 * Costs

Migrating of existing applications to AWS isn't as simple as copying and pasting existing infrastructure. Application owners will need to work with advice from the Autobots and other MDTs to create resilient cloud infrastructure. This can be helped by some of the [Tools](tools_index.md) that have been developed at GA.
