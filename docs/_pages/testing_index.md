### Introduction

Developers at GA are encouraged to have wide test coverage of all systems they are involved with. Testing allows developers to find problems early and provides confidence when making changes to code. It is also a key part of our continuous delivery pipelines.

### Conclusion

We like this excerpt from [The Way of Testivus](http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf):

The pupil asked the master programmer:
“When can I stop writing tests?”
The master answered:
“When you stop writing code.”
The pupil asked:
“When do I stop writing code?”
The master answered:
“When you become a manager.”
The pupil trembled and asked:
“When do I become a manager?”
The master answered:
“When you stop writing tests.”
The pupil rushed to write some tests.
He left skid marks.
